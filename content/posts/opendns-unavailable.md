### Introduction

On June 28, 2024, OpenDNS, a popular DNS resolver service, ceased its operations in France and Portugal. This decision has sparked significant discussion and concern among internet users and tech enthusiasts. This article delves into the reasons behind this move, the legal context, and the broader implications for internet freedom and security.

### The Legal Context

The suspension of OpenDNS services in France is primarily due to a court order issued under Article L.333-10 of the French Sport Code. This article mandates the blocking of services that facilitate access to unauthorized sports broadcasts. Similarly, in Portugal, the service was halted under Article 210-G (3) of the Portuguese Copyright Code.

### The Impact on Users

OpenDNS was widely used for its reliability and speed in translating domain names into IP addresses. Its sudden unavailability has left many users scrambling for alternatives. The decision to block OpenDNS entirely, rather than implementing targeted filtering, has been criticized for its broad and disruptive impact.

### Reactions and Alternatives

The move has been met with mixed reactions. While some understand the legal necessity, others see it as a heavy-handed approach that undermines internet freedom. Alternatives such as Cloudflare (1.1.1.1), Google DNS (8.8.8.8), and local services like [DNS0](https://www.dns0.eu/) and [FDN](https://www.fdn.fr/) have been suggested for users in France.

### Broader Implications

This situation highlights the ongoing tension between copyright enforcement and internet freedom. The decision by OpenDNS to withdraw services rather than comply with filtering demands sets a precedent that could influence other DNS providers and countries. It raises important questions about the role of private companies in regulating internet access and the balance between legal compliance and user rights.

### Conclusion

The end of OpenDNS services in France marks a significant moment in the ongoing debate over internet regulation. As users adapt to new DNS providers, the broader implications of this decision will continue to unfold, shaping the future of internet governance and freedom.
